# Digital Escape Velocity site

This a [preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) app generated with the [preact-cli](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli)
for my contract business digital escape velocity.

## Getting started
Node `v7.1.0`

Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

Run Dev
```
npm run dev
```

Build
```
npm run build --no-prerender
```

## Looking forward
Its a start but it obviously needs work

Things left to do:
- Google Analytics âœ…
- Fix the home page, its looking a bit wonky and unbalanced
- Add a blog
- contact form (this will need some service backend I think)
- Prerender flat pages (SEO?)

Nice to haves (later)
- Shrink payload (this is preact after all)
- PRPL pattern done right

Maybes to be considered
- Add portfolio
- People/team page
- Find out if you're doing code splitting right(I don't trust that this auto code splitting works for all patterns)
