### Experience

##### Government Digital Service | Frontend/backend Developer (9 months)
Enda joined the registers team as a backend developer but he ended working extensively on the frontend also as it where he saw the major challenge for register adoption. This means he took a very active role in working with the user centric design team, working with UR, UX, service designers and content designers to figure out what was registers biggest problem when he joined. He actively worked on building out new services to leverage the power of registers as he was was working on registers as well as some open source tools like the accessible-autocomplete which is now being used across industries like banks, insurance brokers, governments etc as the standard for an autocomplete that has inclusion at its core. He was also involved in tools for managing registers, viewing registers and several tools for adopting registers as well as working on the core registers platform itself.
Key achievements

Acessible autocomplete https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2017/04/20/were-building-an-autocomplete/

##### Ministry of Justice & Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service | Full stack Developer (1 year)
During Enda’s time in MoJ he worked on the Common Platform Program; an enterprise software project tasked at revolutionising the paper based court process. The system backend was designed using domain driven design and the software architecture was an asynchronous system with a mix of CQRS, event sourcing for auditing and consistency, and a postgres datastore. The system's front end was built using AngularJS and the GOV UK frontend toolkit.
Key achievements:
First service on the platform to make it to beta even after starting 18 months later than other teams, at the time of writing this (9 months later) still the only service to make it to production.
Major work on re-architecting our frontend, backend and testing frameworks.


##### Land Registry (9 months)
Lead Developer/Ops on Signing a digital Mortgage deed
During this project in the land registry I took a leadership role following some major changes with the project. The service was "sign a deed", which I joined after discovery. The project was very interesting, signing deeds online is obviously a very difficult problem but we had a great team of clever people who knew either technology and the domain very well. The project was very successful. The tech stack was python flask, puppet, py.test, cucumber, capybara, java, C# and ruby.
Key achievements:
Successful Alpha
Successful Beta

##### Department for Work and Pensions | Software Engineer/DevOps (1 year)
During Enda’s time in DWP, he worked on a 2 month ALPHA and 7 months of the BETA for a piece of software known as Secure Change of Circumstances.
The team’s main aim was to design and build a highly scalable security platform, which would eventually be used to defend all DWP online services from harm and fraud. The security platform alone consisted of over 20 micro service applications backed by Gov Verify’s identity assurance, which he was responsible for in ALPHA.
In order to test the security platform we built 2 separate digital services. The “Change of Address” service was accredited by GDS following our ALPHA review and was praised even though it wasn’t the focus of the project.
The main technologies Enda worked on for this project was Dropwizard, Ruby, NodeJS, Scala, Mongo, PostgreSQL, Ansible, Puppet, NGINX, Logstash, and Kibana.
Key Achievements:
Successful ALPHA.
Successful Gov Verify test implementation.
Became the lead DevOps on the security platform while also being a developer.

##### Department for International Development | Software engineer (6 months)
Dev Tracker was a project proposed by DFID, in which we would provide transparency to both the public and stakeholders showing exactly how much of their tax pounds were being spent and where.
Enda worked on the project for a large part of the BETA until the project was completed and moved into support. The major technologies we used include Scala, Ruby, Neo4j, BaseX and D3 for graphing.
Key Achievements:
Completed BETA: http://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/
Successful up skilled DFID staff to take over further development of the software

##### GDS Cabinet Office | Software Engineer (6 months)
During Enda’s time in GDS in Aviation House, he worked on GIST or the government interrogation spending tool. The purpose of this tool was to provide transparency to the public of how much each department were spending.
The team were charged with building a system that would read in the multitudes of different types of data, understand what it meant and convert all of that into meaningful graphs and tables so the public could easily consume it.
Technologies used include Ruby, Jekyll, and D3.
Key Achievement:
This service went live but has since been archived for political reasons. Code can be found here https://github.com/alphagov/government-interrogation-spending-tool/commits/master
